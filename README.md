Cryptography Course Codes

This repository contains implementations of various cryptographic algorithms and utilities created during the Cryptography course. Below is a list of the codes, along with a brief overview of their functionalities, inputs, and outputs:

List of Codes:

phi_calculator.py
The program includes functions to find numbers coprime to a given number 'x' and calculates Euler's Totient Function ('phi') for 'x' -> Ï•(n).
Input:
An integer value 'x' for which coprime numbers are calculated.
Output:
List of numbers coprime to 'x'.
Value of Euler's Totient Function ('phi') for 'x'.
